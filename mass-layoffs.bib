  abstract = {Deciding which field to study is one of the most consequential decisions college students make, but most research on the topic focuses on students attending 4-year colleges. To understand how students attending community colleges make field-of-study decisions, I link administrative educational records of recent high school graduates with local mass layoff and plant-closing announcements. I find that declines in local employment deter students from entering closely related community college programs and instead induce them to enroll in other vocationally oriented programs. Students predominantly shift enrollment between programs that lead to occupations requiring similar skills.}

  abstract = {Large shocks to local labor markets can cause long-lasting changes to employment, unemployment, and the local labor force. This study examines the relationship between mass layoffs and the long-run size of the local labor force. The authors consider four main channels through which the local labor force may adjust: in-migration, out-migration, retirement, and disability insurance enrollment. These channels, primarily out-migration, account for more than half of the labor force reduction over the past two decades. Findings show, however, that during and after the Great Recession, instead of out-migration, non-participation in the labor force grew to account for most of the local labor force exits following a mass layoff.}

  abstract = {We examine how workers invest in human capital following unanticipated local labor market downturns. We find that, on average, two-year college enrollment increases by three students within three years for every one hundred workers laid off. This rise in enrollment accounts for half the observed increase in labor force nonparticipation following mass layoffs. Completions in career-technical programs also increase, especially in short-term certificates, but vary by field of study. We find the effect on completions is strongest in fields of study with larger earnings returns.}
